# Anxiety-Level-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Anxiety is a multifaceted psychological concept that encompasses a variety of aspects associated with excessive worrying that can hinder normal functioning. This study  aims to forecast the anxiety level of the individual based on the 14 questions that they answered. In order to compute the anxiety level of an individual several machine learning models are trained.
